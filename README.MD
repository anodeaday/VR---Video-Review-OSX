==================================================================


*Created as part of the website http://www.stateofvr.com*

There seems to be a lack of easy to use- 360 video playback for the desktop. Especially for the review process. This app should change that. 

**Features**
-Navigate using mouse
-Prints out frame number and allows scrubbing the timeline
-Use J / L to step forward and backward through frames.
- K or Spacebar to pause and play video
-Swop between 360 view or original latlong
-Toggle Fullscreen

**Openframeworks**
Copy to myApps, requires addon 
-ofxDatGui - http://braitsch.github.io/ofxDatGui

*During compile the contents of the data folder is copied into the app folder, therefore making the app portable - no need to drag along the data folder.*

Built using Openframeworks 0.9.2
Tested on OSX 10.10 but should work on 10.8+

**Interaction:**

Tap and drag to change camera view

Double tap to swop to google cardboard mode ï‚œ
